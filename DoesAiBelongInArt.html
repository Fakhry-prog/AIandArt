            <h2>First of all... What defines art & AI?</h2>
            <p>
			General arts is the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination, often to communicate ideas,
			emotions, or experiences. General arts covers all aspect, such as Music, Art, and Literature. General art can be 	realistic or abstract , traditional or experimental, and its interpretation often depends on the viewer’s perspective.
			 Throughout history, art has played a crucial role in shaping societies, preserving heritage, and inspiring change. 
			It continues to evolve as new technologies and ideas emerge, but its core purpose remains the same: to express and connect. 
			</p>
			<p>AI, also known as artificial intelligence, is the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. <i>(Britannica)</i></p>
            <p>With this we can see that art is meant to be made by humans and for humans which requires skill and imagination.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>For now, we will categorize art into 3 subjects which are music, imagery art and literature.</p>

            <h2>AI In Music</h2>
            <p>Music is art that is concerned with combining vocal or instrumental sounds for 
			beauty of form or emotional expression.</p>
            <p>AI arts could lead to the misinterpretations of culturally important arts by gathering the wrong sources of information through code errors and misleading information on the media. 

 

This is the case where AI uses instruments from the wrong region to be used in a song that was prompted to be from a different region as how AI works based on algorithm and its simplification. 

 

AI could also overshadow the lesser known artists from lesser known countries as it creates a lot of competition that would be difficult for artists to beat. So, to prevent AI from using your music, you can be signed to a label or have your music be protected by copyright laws or have producer tags to your works. Currently, there are no ways to add anti AI filters to music.

            <h2>AI In Visual Art</h2>
            <p>AI has the potential to revolutionize the art world by providing faster processes, tracking, and assessing value. However, it raises ethical questions about authorship, creativity, and emotion. AI-generated art is gaining popularity, potentially disrupting the traditional art market. Marketplaces like 1stDibs, Artsy, and Saatchi use AI algorithms to recommend artworks, but may overlook lesser-known artists. AI tools are being used in museums and galleries to identify overlooked artists, monitor artworks, and design exhibitions. 

Some solutions to prevent AI from stealing art as data include digital "cloaking" tools like Glaze and Nightshade. Glaze is designed to protect human artists by disrupting style mimicry, while Nightshade is an offensive tool for artists to disrupt models that scrape their images without consent.

            <h2>AI In Literature</h2>
            <p>With the recent rise and popularity of artificial intelligence (AI), companies have utilized the technology in different ways. For example, Squibler advertises itself as the ‘best’ novel-writing tool, and Story Engine can create whole novels out of prompts. Writers use it too. Tim Boucher is a writer who used AI to create 120 novels.  

AI is also capable of misusing the stories available online. For example, writer Jane Friedman found fraudulent novels being sold online, claiming to be her works. They turned out to be AI-generated books, written using information in her existing novels. Author George RR Martin sued OpenAI for copyright infringement by training their models on the author’s books. As AI is trained on data available on the internet, the works of writers are often stolen without their consent. 

However, there are ways to overcome this by preventing AI from accessing websites and stealing literary content. A method is by using the robot.txt file. Using a robot.txt file, web crawlers or bots, including AI bots, that collect information from websites can be blocked from accessing your site. 

First, create a file on a plain text website, like Notepad and TextEdit, and naming it robot.txt. Then, save the file as robot.txt without any extensions, as word processors can prevent the file from working. To locate your website’s new robot.txt file, simply add “/robot.txt” to the end of the website’s URL. It has to be placed as “www.example.com/robots.txt”, not as a subdirectory. Robot.txt files can also be used for PDFs and HTMLs. 

If the file is accessible, the contents will be displayed in plain text format. Then, manually insert directives to block certain AI crawlers on your robot.txt file as disallowed user agents. The result is that bots from these AI programs can no longer access and crawl the website. </p>
