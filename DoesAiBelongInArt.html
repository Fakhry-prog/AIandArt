            <h2>First of all... What defines art & AI?</h2>
            <p>
			Art is the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination, typically in a visual<br> form such as painting or sculpture, producing works to <br>be appreciated primarily for their beauty or emotional power. <i>(Oxford Languages)</i>
			</p>
			<p>AI, also known as artificial intelligence, is the <br> ability of a digital computer or <br>computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. <i>(Britannica)</i></p>
            <p>With this we can see that art is meant to be made by humans and for humans which requires skill and imagination.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>For now, we will categorize art into 3 subjects which are music, imagery art and literature.</p>

            <h2>AI In Music</h2>
            <p>Music is art that is concerned with combining vocal or instrumental sounds for 
			beauty of form or emotional expression.</p>
            <p>Some people have concerns whether AI strips away the cultural and the special human inspirations that music have and if AI should be considered a tool that is used for 
			assisting with people who is having writer's block.

            <h2>AI In Actual Art</h2>
            <p>Art is a visual object or experience consciously created through an expression of skill or imagination. 
			The term art encompasses diverse media such as painting, sculpture, 
			printmaking, drawing, decorative arts, photography, and installation. </p>
            <p>People have concerns regarding AI taking the jobs of artists and photographers. People also may consider companies who utilise AI generated images and videos are lazy
			and lacking in effort. But AI could assist artists that are struggling with creativity. AI could also provide a starter for the marketing department in smaller companies.

            <h2>AI In Literature</h2>
            <p>AI’s global rise requires international cooperation in both development and regulation. In literature, 
			it offers creative support but risks too much reliance, which could negatively affect critical thinking and literature skills. 
			A study on Indonesian students highlights AI's role in education but warns of dependency. Globally, 
			AI-authored books challenge authenticity and societal norms, while nationally, countries must decide their sides on AI-generated content.</p>
            <p>The fear of AI stems from its unpredictability and rapid growth, despite being inspired by human creativity.</p>
